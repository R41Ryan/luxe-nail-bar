        <h2>Our Health and Safety Standards</h2>
        <p>
          At Luxe Nail Bar, your health and safety are our top priorities. We
          adhere to strict sanitation protocols to ensure a clean and
          comfortable experience for every client.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sterilized Tools</strong> - All reusable tools are
            thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized after every use to
            meet professional hygiene standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disposable Products</strong> - We never reuse files,
            buffers, or other disposable products between clients. Each client
            receives fresh, single-use items to prevent cross-contamination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean & Hygienic Environment</strong> - Our workstations,
            treatment areas, and shared spaces are regularly disinfected to
            maintain a spotless and safe atmosphere.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safe & High-Quality Products</strong> - We use
            professional-grade, non-toxic products that are gentle on your nails
            and skin while maintaining the highest level of cleanliness.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your well-being matters to us, and we are committed to providing a
          safe, relaxing, and luxurious experience every time you visit.
